''' Logistic Regression
Example: Predicting whether a student gets admitted into a university using logistic regression. 
Problem Statement: Given the scores of a student in two exams, predict whether the student gets admitted into the university.
* We have historical data from previous applicants that we can use as a training set for logistic regression. 
* For each training example, we have the applicant’s scores on two exams and the admissions decision. 
* Task is to build a classification model that estimates an applicant’s probability of admission based on the scores from those two exams. '''

# Loading and visualizing the data

''' - `X_train` contains exam scores on two exams for a student

    - `y_train = 1` if the student was admitted 
    - `y_train = 0` if the student was not admitted 
    - Both `X_train` and `y_train` are numpy arrays. '''
